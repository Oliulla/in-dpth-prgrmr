## 🌍 What Is an Operating System?

An **Operating System (OS)** is **software that manages hardware resources** and provides services for computer programs.

> It's the middleman between your apps and the physical computer.

### 🎛 OS Responsibilities (The Big 6)

| Area                      | What It Does                                                    |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ **Process Management** | Runs and manages programs (called processes)                    |

| 3️⃣ **File System**        | Organizes data into files and directories                       |
| 4️⃣ **I/O Management**     | Manages input/output devices (keyboard, screen, disk, etc.)     |
| 5️⃣ **Scheduling & CPU**   | Decides which program uses the CPU, when, and for how long      |
| 6️⃣ **Security & Access**  | Ensures users and processes only access what they’re allowed to |

## 👨‍🏫 How Is an OS Structured?

An OS typically consists of **multiple layers**, the most important being:

### 1. **Kernel** (core of the OS)

- Directly talks to hardware.
- Handles memory, CPU, I/O devices.
- Example: Linux kernel

### 2. **System Calls Interface**

- Lets user applications request services from the kernel (like opening a file or creating a process).

### 3. **User Space**

- Apps like browsers, editors, games, etc.
- These apps **don’t talk to hardware directly** — they go through the OS.

## 📊 Types of Operating Systems (Just for Perspective)

| Type                         | Example Use Case                              |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 🖥 **General-purpose**        | Windows, Linux, macOS (PCs, laptops)          |
| 📱 **Mobile OS**             | Android, iOS                                  |
| ⚙️ **Real-Time OS (RTOS)**   | Embedded systems, satellites, medical devices |
| 🖧 **Network OS**             | Routers, servers                              |
| 🎮 **Batch/Multitasking OS** | Legacy systems, supercomputers                |

---

## 🔄 How the OS Interacts With Hardware (High-Level Flow)

```text
[ Application ]     ← wants to save a file
      ↓
[ System Call ]     ← asks kernel to write
      ↓
[ Kernel ]          ← checks permissions, allocates memory
      ↓
[ Device Driver ]   ← talks to hardware
      ↓
[ Disk Controller ] ← stores data
```

This separation is **critical for security, abstraction, and stability**.

## 🧩 OS vs Kernel vs Shell

| Term       | Role                                                             |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OS**     | The full software that manages hardware and software             |
| **Kernel** | Core part of the OS that runs in memory, handles low-level tasks |
| **Shell**  | Interface (CLI) between user and OS (e.g., Bash, Zsh)            |

## 🛠 Tools to Observe OS in Action (you’ll use these later)

| Tool          | What It Shows                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `top`, `htop` | Active processes & CPU usage         |
| `ps`          | Process status                       |
| `lsof`        | List of open files by processes      |
| `strace`      | Track system calls made by a program |
| `dmesg`       | Kernel log                           |

---

## ✅ You’re Ready For:

Now that we’ve built the foundation, you’re ready to go **topic by topic**, starting with:

1. **Processes and Scheduling** — (what is a process, how multitasking works, how the CPU decides what to run)
2. **Memory Management**
3. **File Systems**
4. **System Calls**
5. **User vs Kernel Mode**
6. **Interrupts and I/O**

---

Want to start with **Processes**?  
I’ll break it down visually and logically — no code, just deep concept.

Awesome! Let’s now **dive into the first core topic** of OS:

---

# 🧠 1️⃣ Processes & Scheduling (Beginner to Intermediate Theory)

A **process** is the **execution of a program** — it's _not_ the program itself (that's just a file on disk).  
Once you run a program, the OS creates a **process** that includes its memory, registers, file handles, etc.

---

## 🔹 What Exactly Is a Process?

| 🧩 Component         | Description                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code (Text)**      | The actual instructions of the program             |
| **Data**             | Global/static variables                            |
| **Heap**             | Dynamically allocated memory (via `malloc`, etc.)  |
| **Stack**            | Local variables, function calls, return addresses  |
| **Program Counter**  | Keeps track of which instruction is being executed |
| **Registers**        | Store temporary values used by the CPU             |
| **Process ID (PID)** | Unique number to identify the process              |

🔍 When you run a program, it gets loaded into memory, and the OS sets up **this structure in memory** for the process.

---

## 🔄 Process Lifecycle

```text
[ New ] → [ Ready ] → [ Running ] → [ Waiting ] → [ Terminated ]
               ↑                         ↓
           [ Back to Ready ] ← [ Event Complete ]
```

### 🔹 States Explained:

| State          | Meaning                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **New**        | Process is being created                 |
| **Ready**      | Waiting to be assigned to the CPU        |
| **Running**    | Currently executing on CPU               |
| **Waiting**    | Waiting for some event (I/O, disk, etc.) |
| **Terminated** | Finished execution                       |

---

## 🧠 Multitasking & Context Switching

Modern OSes run **many processes at once**, but a CPU can usually only execute **one instruction stream at a time**.

So, the OS:

1. Switches between processes quickly.
2. Saves a process’s state (registers, PC, etc.).
3. Loads another process’s state.
4. Repeats — this is called **context switching**.

> Context Switching is like pausing a video game, saving the state, loading a different game, and later resuming the first one.

---

## ⏱ Process Scheduling

Since multiple processes compete for CPU, the OS uses a **scheduler** to decide **who runs next**.

### 🔹 Scheduling Algorithms

| Algorithm               | Description                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FCFS**                | First-Come, First-Served (simplest but can cause delays)               |
| **SJF**                 | Shortest Job First (fastest overall, but hard to predict job lengths)  |
| **Round Robin**         | Each process gets a fixed time slice (used in time-sharing systems)    |
| **Priority Scheduling** | Processes with higher priority get the CPU first                       |
| **Multilevel Queue**    | Multiple queues based on priority/type of task (interactive vs. batch) |

⚙️ Most modern OSes use **a hybrid**, like **Linux's Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)**.

---

## 🔐 Processes vs Threads

| Concept    | Process                                 | Thread                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Memory     | Each has **separate memory**            | Threads **share process memory**            |
| Overhead   | Heavier (more isolation)                | Lightweight                                 |
| Crash Risk | One process crash doesn’t affect others | One thread crash can bring down the process |
| Example    | Running `chrome`                        | Multiple tabs inside `chrome`               |

> Threads = **Lightweight processes** inside a process.

---

## 📁 Process Control Block (PCB)

Every process is represented in the OS with a **Process Control Block (PCB)**.  
It stores:

- PID
- Process state
- Program counter
- CPU registers
- Memory pointers
- I/O status

The OS uses PCBs to track and switch between processes efficiently.

---

## 🛠 Real-World Commands (Just to Observe)

You’ll use these later (but you can try now in Linux/Mac terminal):

| Command          | Purpose                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| `ps aux`         | Show all running processes  |
| `top` or `htop`  | Real-time view of processes |
| `kill <PID>`     | Terminate a process         |
| `nice`, `renice` | Set process priority        |

---

## 🧠 Summary

- A **process** is a running instance of a program with its own memory and resources.
- OS uses **scheduling algorithms** to share CPU among processes.
- **Context switching** lets the CPU jump between tasks.
- **Threads** allow multitasking _within_ a single process (lightweight, shared memory).
- Every process is tracked by a **PCB**.

---

You’re now solid on **Processes & Scheduling**.  
Next, we’ll explore **Memory Management** — virtual memory, paging, heap/stack, and how the OS makes RAM feel infinite.

Wanna move to that next?

Perfect — let’s move on to **Memory Management**, one of the most **core pillars** of operating systems.

---

# 🧠 2️⃣ Memory Management (Beginner to Intermediate Theory)

Memory (RAM) is where your programs **live while they run**.  
The OS decides **who gets what memory**, **how much**, and **where** — all while making sure no one steps on someone else’s memory.

---

## 🔹 Why Memory Management?

- Prevent processes from accessing each other’s memory.
- Efficiently use limited RAM.
- Allow multitasking.
- Support virtual memory (run programs bigger than RAM!).

---

## 📦 Process Memory Layout

When a process runs, its memory is divided into logical sections:

```txt
+------------------+ ← High Memory
|     Stack        | ← local vars, function calls
+------------------+
|     Heap         | ← malloc/free
+------------------+
|  Uninitialized   | ← .bss
| Global Variables |
+------------------+ ← .data & .text
|   Code (Text)    |
+------------------+ ← Low Memory (Program Entry Point)
```

---

## 🧱 Virtual Memory: The Illusion of Infinite RAM

Each process thinks it has the **whole memory to itself**.

How?

> The OS maps each process’s **virtual memory** to the **real physical memory** (RAM) using a **Memory Management Unit (MMU)** in the CPU.

So:

- **Virtual Address** → What the process sees
- **Physical Address** → Actual RAM location

---

## 🔹 Paging: Core Virtual Memory Mechanism

The OS breaks memory into small, fixed-size chunks called **pages** (typically 4KB).  
RAM is divided into **frames** of the same size.

| Concept        | Description                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Page**       | A chunk of virtual memory                  |
| **Frame**      | A chunk of physical memory                 |
| **Page Table** | Maps virtual pages → physical frames       |
| **MMU**        | Uses the page table to translate addresses |

### Example:

```
Virtual Addr 0x1234 → Page 1 → Frame 7 → Physical Addr 0x7434
```

---

## 🔄 Page Faults: When Things Go Wrong

If a process tries to access a page **not currently in RAM**, a **page fault** occurs.

Then:

1. OS finds the page in disk (swap).
2. Loads it into RAM.
3. Updates page table.
4. Resumes the process.

This is how the OS makes it **look like you have more RAM than you really do**.

---

## 🧠 Stack vs Heap

| Feature    | Stack                            | Heap                             |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Purpose    | Function calls & local variables | Dynamic memory (`malloc`/`free`) |
| Allocation | Automatically managed            | Manually managed                 |
| Growth     | Downward                         | Upward                           |
| Speed      | Very fast                        | Slower                           |
| Size Limit | Small                            | Larger                           |

---

## 🧠 Swapping & Page Replacement

When RAM is full, OS **swaps** pages to disk.

**Page Replacement Algorithms:**

- FIFO (First In, First Out)
- LRU (Least Recently Used)
- Clock Algorithm

---

## 🔐 Memory Protection

- OS ensures **no process can access** memory it doesn't own.
- If it does → **Segmentation Fault** or **Access Violation**.
- Done via hardware + OS (using **page tables** and **flags**).

---

## 🔧 Real-World Tools You’ll Use Later

| Command      | What It Shows                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `free -h`    | RAM usage                       |
| `vmstat`     | Virtual memory stats            |
| `top`/`htop` | Per-process memory usage        |
| `pmap <PID>` | Memory map of a running process |

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- OS uses **virtual memory** to isolate processes and manage RAM smartly.
- **Paging** lets the OS map virtual memory to physical memory.
- Stack and Heap are two major memory regions for programs.
- **Page faults** trigger the OS to load data from disk if not in RAM.
- **Memory protection** isolates processes to improve security and stability.

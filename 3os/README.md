## 👨‍🏫 How Is an OS Structured?

An OS typically consists of **multiple layers**, the most important being:

### 1. **Kernel** (core of the OS)

- Directly talks to hardware.
- Handles memory, CPU, I/O devices.
- Example: Linux kernel

### 2. **System Calls Interface**

- Lets user applications request services from the kernel (like opening a file or creating a process).

### 3. **User Space**

- Apps like browsers, editors, games, etc.
- These apps **don’t talk to hardware directly** — they go through the OS.

## 📊 Types of Operating Systems (Just for Perspective)

| Type                         | Example Use Case                              |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 🖥 **General-purpose**        | Windows, Linux, macOS (PCs, laptops)          |
| 📱 **Mobile OS**             | Android, iOS                                  |
| ⚙️ **Real-Time OS (RTOS)**   | Embedded systems, satellites, medical devices |
| 🖧 **Network OS**             | Routers, servers                              |
| 🎮 **Batch/Multitasking OS** | Legacy systems, supercomputers                |

---

## 🔄 How the OS Interacts With Hardware (High-Level Flow)

```text
[ Application ]     ← wants to save a file
      ↓
[ System Call ]     ← asks kernel to write
      ↓
[ Kernel ]          ← checks permissions, allocates memory
      ↓
[ Device Driver ]   ← talks to hardware
      ↓
[ Disk Controller ] ← stores data
```

This separation is **critical for security, abstraction, and stability**.

## 🧩 OS vs Kernel vs Shell

| Term       | Role                                                             |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OS**     | The full software that manages hardware and software             |
| **Kernel** | Core part of the OS that runs in memory, handles low-level tasks |
| **Shell**  | Interface (CLI) between user and OS (e.g., Bash, Zsh)            |

---

## 🛠 Tools to Observe OS in Action (you’ll use these later)

| Tool          | What It Shows                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `top`, `htop` | Active processes & CPU usage         |
| `ps`          | Process status                       |
| `lsof`        | List of open files by processes      |
| `strace`      | Track system calls made by a program |
| `dmesg`       | Kernel log                           |

---

## ✅ You’re Ready For:

Now that we’ve built the foundation, you’re ready to go **topic by topic**, starting with:

1. **Processes and Scheduling** — (what is a process, how multitasking works, how the CPU decides what to run)
2. **Memory Management**
3. **File Systems**
4. **System Calls**
5. **User vs Kernel Mode**
6. **Interrupts and I/O**

---

Want to start with **Processes**?  
I’ll break it down visually and logically — no code, just deep concept.

Awesome! Let’s now **dive into the first core topic** of OS:

---

# 🧠 1️⃣ Processes & Scheduling (Beginner to Intermediate Theory)

A **process** is the **execution of a program** — it's _not_ the program itself (that's just a file on disk).  
Once you run a program, the OS creates a **process** that includes its memory, registers, file handles, etc.

---

## 🔹 What Exactly Is a Process?

| 🧩 Component         | Description                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code (Text)**      | The actual instructions of the program             |
| **Data**             | Global/static variables                            |
| **Heap**             | Dynamically allocated memory (via `malloc`, etc.)  |
| **Stack**            | Local variables, function calls, return addresses  |
| **Program Counter**  | Keeps track of which instruction is being executed |
| **Registers**        | Store temporary values used by the CPU             |
| **Process ID (PID)** | Unique number to identify the process              |

🔍 When you run a program, it gets loaded into memory, and the OS sets up **this structure in memory** for the process.

---

## 🔄 Process Lifecycle

```text
[ New ] → [ Ready ] → [ Running ] → [ Waiting ] → [ Terminated ]
               ↑                         ↓
           [ Back to Ready ] ← [ Event Complete ]
```

### 🔹 States Explained:

| State          | Meaning                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **New**        | Process is being created                 |
| **Ready**      | Waiting to be assigned to the CPU        |
| **Running**    | Currently executing on CPU               |
| **Waiting**    | Waiting for some event (I/O, disk, etc.) |
| **Terminated** | Finished execution                       |

---

## 🧠 Multitasking & Context Switching

Modern OSes run **many processes at once**, but a CPU can usually only execute **one instruction stream at a time**.

So, the OS:

1. Switches between processes quickly.
2. Saves a process’s state (registers, PC, etc.).
3. Loads another process’s state.
4. Repeats — this is called **context switching**.

> Context Switching is like pausing a video game, saving the state, loading a different game, and later resuming the first one.

---

## ⏱ Process Scheduling

Since multiple processes compete for CPU, the OS uses a **scheduler** to decide **who runs next**.

### 🔹 Scheduling Algorithms

| Algorithm               | Description                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FCFS**                | First-Come, First-Served (simplest but can cause delays)               |
| **SJF**                 | Shortest Job First (fastest overall, but hard to predict job lengths)  |
| **Round Robin**         | Each process gets a fixed time slice (used in time-sharing systems)    |
| **Priority Scheduling** | Processes with higher priority get the CPU first                       |
| **Multilevel Queue**    | Multiple queues based on priority/type of task (interactive vs. batch) |

⚙️ Most modern OSes use **a hybrid**, like **Linux's Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)**.

---

## 🔐 Processes vs Threads

| Concept    | Process                                 | Thread                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Memory     | Each has **separate memory**            | Threads **share process memory**            |
| Overhead   | Heavier (more isolation)                | Lightweight                                 |
| Crash Risk | One process crash doesn’t affect others | One thread crash can bring down the process |
| Example    | Running `chrome`                        | Multiple tabs inside `chrome`               |

> Threads = **Lightweight processes** inside a process.

---

## 📁 Process Control Block (PCB)

Every process is represented in the OS with a **Process Control Block (PCB)**.  
It stores:

- PID
- Process state
- Program counter
- CPU registers
- Memory pointers
- I/O status

The OS uses PCBs to track and switch between processes efficiently.

---

## 🛠 Real-World Commands (Just to Observe)

You’ll use these later (but you can try now in Linux/Mac terminal):

| Command          | Purpose                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| `ps aux`         | Show all running processes  |
| `top` or `htop`  | Real-time view of processes |
| `kill <PID>`     | Terminate a process         |
| `nice`, `renice` | Set process priority        |

---

## 🧠 Summary

- A **process** is a running instance of a program with its own memory and resources.
- OS uses **scheduling algorithms** to share CPU among processes.
- **Context switching** lets the CPU jump between tasks.
- **Threads** allow multitasking _within_ a single process (lightweight, shared memory).
- Every process is tracked by a **PCB**.

---

You’re now solid on **Processes & Scheduling**.  
Next, we’ll explore **Memory Management** — virtual memory, paging, heap/stack, and how the OS makes RAM feel infinite.

Wanna move to that next?

Perfect — let’s move on to **Memory Management**, one of the most **core pillars** of operating systems.

---

# 🧠 2️⃣ Memory Management (Beginner to Intermediate Theory)

Memory (RAM) is where your programs **live while they run**.  
The OS decides **who gets what memory**, **how much**, and **where** — all while making sure no one steps on someone else’s memory.

---

## 🔹 Why Memory Management?

- Prevent processes from accessing each other’s memory.
- Efficiently use limited RAM.
- Allow multitasking.
- Support virtual memory (run programs bigger than RAM!).

---

## 📦 Process Memory Layout

When a process runs, its memory is divided into logical sections:

```txt
+------------------+ ← High Memory
|     Stack        | ← local vars, function calls
+------------------+
|     Heap         | ← malloc/free
+------------------+
|  Uninitialized   | ← .bss
| Global Variables |
+------------------+ ← .data & .text
|   Code (Text)    |
+------------------+ ← Low Memory (Program Entry Point)
```

---

## 🧱 Virtual Memory: The Illusion of Infinite RAM

Each process thinks it has the **whole memory to itself**.

How?

> The OS maps each process’s **virtual memory** to the **real physical memory** (RAM) using a **Memory Management Unit (MMU)** in the CPU.

So:

- **Virtual Address** → What the process sees
- **Physical Address** → Actual RAM location

---

## 🔹 Paging: Core Virtual Memory Mechanism

The OS breaks memory into small, fixed-size chunks called **pages** (typically 4KB).  
RAM is divided into **frames** of the same size.

| Concept        | Description                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Page**       | A chunk of virtual memory                  |
| **Frame**      | A chunk of physical memory                 |
| **Page Table** | Maps virtual pages → physical frames       |
| **MMU**        | Uses the page table to translate addresses |

### Example:

```
Virtual Addr 0x1234 → Page 1 → Frame 7 → Physical Addr 0x7434
```

---

## 🔄 Page Faults: When Things Go Wrong

If a process tries to access a page **not currently in RAM**, a **page fault** occurs.

Then:

1. OS finds the page in disk (swap).
2. Loads it into RAM.
3. Updates page table.
4. Resumes the process.

This is how the OS makes it **look like you have more RAM than you really do**.

---

## 🧠 Stack vs Heap

| Feature    | Stack                            | Heap                             |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Purpose    | Function calls & local variables | Dynamic memory (`malloc`/`free`) |
| Allocation | Automatically managed            | Manually managed                 |
| Growth     | Downward                         | Upward                           |
| Speed      | Very fast                        | Slower                           |
| Size Limit | Small                            | Larger                           |

---

## 🧠 Swapping & Page Replacement

When RAM is full, OS **swaps** pages to disk.

**Page Replacement Algorithms:**

- FIFO (First In, First Out)
- LRU (Least Recently Used)
- Clock Algorithm

---

## 🔐 Memory Protection

- OS ensures **no process can access** memory it doesn't own.
- If it does → **Segmentation Fault** or **Access Violation**.
- Done via hardware + OS (using **page tables** and **flags**).

---

## 🔧 Real-World Tools You’ll Use Later

| Command      | What It Shows                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `free -h`    | RAM usage                       |
| `vmstat`     | Virtual memory stats            |
| `top`/`htop` | Per-process memory usage        |
| `pmap <PID>` | Memory map of a running process |

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- OS uses **virtual memory** to isolate processes and manage RAM smartly.
- **Paging** lets the OS map virtual memory to physical memory.
- Stack and Heap are two major memory regions for programs.
- **Page faults** trigger the OS to load data from disk if not in RAM.
- **Memory protection** isolates processes to improve security and stability.

---

Next up — we’ll explore how the OS manages **files and file systems**:  
how it lets you save, read, and organize data on disks.

Ready to continue?

Awesome — let’s now dive into **Files & File Systems**, which is crucial to understanding how an OS handles **persistent storage** (like SSDs, HDDs, USBs, etc).

---

# 💽 3️⃣ Files & File Systems (Beginner to Intermediate Theory)

Every time you save a photo, open a document, or run a program, you're interacting with the **file system**, a core part of any operating system.

---

## 🔹 What is a File?

A **file** is simply a **named collection of bytes** stored on disk.  
The OS manages files so that:

- Data is stored persistently.
- Programs can read/write data.
- Files are organized and secured.

---

## 🔹 File System Components

| Component       | Purpose                                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Files**       | Store data                                                            |
| **Directories** | Organize files hierarchically                                         |
| **Metadata**    | Info about files (name, size, owner, permissions, timestamps)         |
| **Inode**       | A data structure that stores file metadata and block pointers         |
| **Superblock**  | Contains info about the entire file system (total blocks, free space) |
| **Block**       | Smallest unit of disk space (e.g., 4KB)                               |

---

## 📁 Directory Structure (Filesystem Hierarchy)

Most modern OSes (like Linux, macOS) use a **hierarchical tree structure**:

```bash
/
├── bin     # Essential user binaries
├── etc     # Configuration files
├── home    # User directories
├── var     # Logs and variable data
├── tmp     # Temporary files
├── usr     # User-installed software
```

Everything is under `/` (root).

---

## 🔹 File Operations

The OS exposes APIs for programs to interact with files:

| Operation      | System Call (Linux) | Description                                |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Open file      | `open()`            | Opens a file and returns a file descriptor |
| Read from file | `read()`            | Reads data from a file                     |
| Write to file  | `write()`           | Writes data to a file                      |
| Close file     | `close()`           | Closes the file descriptor                 |
| Delete file    | `unlink()`          | Deletes the file from disk                 |

---

## 🧠 File Descriptors

When you open a file, the OS gives you a **file descriptor** (a number representing an open file).

Example:

```c
int fd = open("myfile.txt", O_RDONLY);
```

| FD  | Purpose        |
| --- | -------------- |
| 0   | stdin          |
| 1   | stdout         |
| 2   | stderr         |
| 3+  | your own files |

---

## 🔐 File Permissions

File security is built into the file system.

Typical Linux permissions look like:

```bash
-rwxr-xr--  1 user group 1234 Jan 1 10:00 script.sh
```

| Symbol | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| `r`    | Read    |
| `w`    | Write   |
| `x`    | Execute |

Ownership: **user**, **group**, **others**

---

## 🗃 Common File Systems

| File System | OS Usage   | Features                            |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| FAT32       | USB drives | Simple, widely compatible           |
| NTFS        | Windows    | Journaling, permissions, encryption |
| ext4        | Linux      | Fast, stable, journaling            |
| APFS        | macOS      | Snapshots, encryption, clones       |

---

## 🧠 Journaling File Systems

Used to **prevent corruption** during crashes or power loss.

- Changes are written to a **journal** (log).
- Once verified, they're committed to disk.
- Example: ext3, ext4, NTFS, APFS.

---

## 🔧 Tools to Explore File Systems

| Tool       | Purpose                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `ls`, `cd` | Navigate directories                |
| `stat`     | View metadata of files              |
| `df`       | Show disk usage                     |
| `du`       | Show file size                      |
| `mount`    | Mount devices or partitions         |
| `umount`   | Unmount devices                     |
| `fsck`     | Check and repair file system errors |

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- The OS abstracts complex disk operations into **simple file APIs**.
- A **file system** keeps files organized and safe.
- Linux uses **inodes** and **block storage** to manage file data.
- File permissions are critical for **security** and **multi-user safety**.

Up next:  
**Process Management** — how the OS runs programs, schedules tasks, handles multitasking, and more.

Let me know when you're ready 👨‍💻

Great! Now let’s move into one of the **most important parts of an operating system**:

---

# 🧠 4️⃣ Process Management (Beginner to Intermediate Theory)

Processes are **the heart of any OS**. Every time you run a program (like a browser or terminal), you’re creating a **process**. Understanding how OS handles them is key for debugging, performance tuning, and backend engineering.

---

## 🔹 What is a Process?

A **process** is a **program in execution**.

When you run a program:

- It’s loaded from disk into memory.
- It gets CPU time to execute.
- It may create child processes.
- It lives in its own **isolated address space**.

---

## 🔹 Process Lifecycle

1. **New** – Process is being created
2. **Ready** – Waiting to be assigned CPU
3. **Running** – Instructions are executing
4. **Waiting** – Waiting for I/O or resources
5. **Terminated** – Finished execution

```
New → Ready → Running → Terminated
             ↓
           Waiting
```

---

## 🔹 Key Concepts

| Concept                  | Explanation                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **PID**                  | Process ID – unique number identifying a process |
| **Parent/Child Process** | A process can create other processes (forking)   |
| **Context Switch**       | Switching CPU from one process to another        |
| **Scheduling**           | Deciding which process runs next                 |
| **Multitasking**         | Running multiple processes seemingly at once     |

---

## 🧠 Context Switching

When switching from Process A to Process B:

1. Save state of A (registers, program counter)
2. Load state of B
3. Continue execution

🔁 This enables **multitasking**, but comes with a **cost** (slowdowns due to memory/cache flushes).

---

## 🔹 Scheduling Algorithms

The OS uses **schedulers** to decide which process runs next:

| Scheduler               | Description                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **FCFS**                | First Come First Serve – simple, unfair   |
| **Round Robin**         | Equal time slices (fair)                  |
| **Priority Scheduling** | Higher-priority processes run first       |
| **Multilevel Queue**    | Grouped by type (interactive vs batch)    |
| **Shortest Job First**  | Best for turnaround time, hard to predict |

Modern OSes use **hybrid/multilevel feedback queues**.

---

## 🔹 Process vs Thread

| Feature       | Process                    | Thread                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Memory        | Separate memory space      | Shared memory space     |
| Overhead      | Higher                     | Lower                   |
| Communication | Slower (IPC)               | Faster (shared memory)  |
| Crash Impact  | Does **not** affect others | Can crash whole process |

---

## 🔐 Isolation & Security

Each process runs in a **sandboxed memory space**:

- Can't access memory of other processes
- Prevents accidental or malicious corruption
- Achieved using **virtual memory** + **hardware-level protection**

---

## 🔧 Linux Commands to Explore Processes

| Command          | Purpose                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `ps aux`         | Show all processes                 |
| `top` or `htop`  | Live process monitor               |
| `kill PID`       | Terminate a process                |
| `nice`, `renice` | Adjust process priority            |
| `strace`         | Trace system calls a process makes |
| `fork()`         | In C: create a child process       |
| `exec()`         | Replace current process image      |

---

Next up:  
🔸 **Multithreading & Concurrency** — how the OS handles multiple threads and avoids chaos like deadlocks and race conditions.

Want to continue?

Awesome — you're doing great! Let’s keep going.

---

# 🧵 5️⃣ **Threads, Concurrency & Synchronization**

Now that you understand **processes**, let’s talk about **threads**, which are like _lightweight processes_ — and crucial for modern operating systems and high-performance backend systems.

---

## 🔹 What is a Thread?

A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution **within a process**.

- A process can have **one or more threads**.
- Threads share the same:
  - Code section
  - Data section (global variables, heap)
  - Open files

But each thread has its own:

- Stack
- Registers
- Program Counter

---

## 🔸 Threads vs Processes

| Feature       | **Process**                           | **Thread**                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Memory Space  | Separate for each process             | Shared among threads in a process          |
| Overhead      | Higher (context switching is heavier) | Lower (lightweight switching)              |
| Communication | Inter-process Communication (IPC)     | Shared memory, easier communication        |
| Failure       | One process crashes, others survive   | One thread crash can take down the process |

---

## 🔹 Concurrency vs Parallelism

| Term            | Meaning                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Concurrency** | Multiple tasks progress **independently**, may or may not be in parallel |
| **Parallelism** | Multiple tasks execute **at the same time** on multiple cores            |

✅ An OS uses **concurrency** to manage many tasks with few resources.  
✅ It uses **parallelism** to take advantage of multicore CPUs.

---

## 🔸 Why Use Threads?

- Better resource utilization
- Faster execution (especially I/O-bound tasks)
- Simpler communication (shared memory)

Used in:

- Web servers (handling multiple clients)
- Background jobs
- Asynchronous tasks

---

## 🔹 Race Conditions (⚠️)

**When two or more threads access shared data and try to change it at the same time**, unpredictable behavior can occur.

Example: Two threads incrementing a shared counter without synchronization.

---

## 🔒 Synchronization Mechanisms

To avoid race conditions, OS uses **synchronization**:

| Tool                         | Purpose                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Mutex** (Mutual Exclusion) | Only one thread can access critical section |
| **Semaphore**                | Allows limited access to a resource         |
| **Spinlock**                 | Busy-waiting lock (for short waits)         |
| **Condition Variable**       | Wait/notify mechanism between threads       |
| **Barrier**                  | Threads wait for each other at a point      |

✅ These ensure **atomicity** and **data integrity**.

---

## 🔄 Deadlocks & Starvation

### 🧨 Deadlock

Four conditions must occur:

1. **Mutual exclusion**
2. **Hold and wait**
3. **No preemption**
4. **Circular wait**

If all are true → Deadlock 💥

Example:

- Thread A holds Lock 1, waiting for Lock 2.
- Thread B holds Lock 2, waiting for Lock 1.

✅ Prevention: Lock ordering, timeout, deadlock detection

---

### 😢 Starvation

A thread waits **indefinitely** while other threads keep getting the lock.

✅ Prevention: Fair scheduling or priority aging.

---

## 👨‍💻 Real-World Relevance

- **Backend APIs** use threading or async for handling many requests.
- **Databases** like MySQL/PostgreSQL use multi-threading.
- **Security exploits** like race conditions and DoS often target thread bugs.
- **Thread management** is crucial in embedded systems, game engines, OS kernels.

---

## 🛠 Tools for Practicing (Optional)

You’ll work with threads when you:

- Use **C (`pthread` library)** or C++
- Use multithreading in Java, Rust, Go, Python
- Build concurrent programs or systems

---

## ✅ What You’ve Learned

- ✅ What are threads
- ✅ Thread vs process
- ✅ Concurrency vs parallelism
- ✅ Race conditions & synchronization
- ✅ Deadlocks and starvation
- ✅ Importance in real-world systems

Ready for the next topic?  
🔸 **Memory Management** — How OS handles memory allocation, paging, segmentation, virtual memory, and more.

Shall we move forward?

Great! Let’s dive into one of the **most important and fascinating** parts of any operating system:

---

# 🧠 6️⃣ **Memory Management**

_(How the OS gives memory to processes, protects it, and makes things fast)_

---

## 🔹 Why Is Memory Management Important?

Every program needs memory — for variables, code, heap, and stack.  
The OS is responsible for:

- Allocating memory to processes
- Keeping them isolated
- Using memory efficiently
- Providing abstraction (virtual memory)

Without memory management, your system would crash constantly or become incredibly slow.

---

## 🔸 Main Responsibilities of the OS

1. **Process Isolation**  
   Prevent one process from accessing another’s memory.

2. **Memory Allocation**  
   Give memory dynamically to programs as needed.

3. **Swapping / Paging**  
   Use disk when RAM is full (called virtual memory).

4. **Protection & Security**  
   Avoid memory corruption, protect kernel space, etc.

---

## 🔹 Memory Layout of a Process

When a process runs, its memory is laid out like this:

```
+-------------------+   ← High memory
|      Stack        |   (Function calls, local vars)
+-------------------+
|      Heap         |   (malloc/free memory)
+-------------------+
|   BSS Segment     |   (Uninitialized globals)
+-------------------+
|   Data Segment    |   (Initialized globals)
+-------------------+
|    Text Segment   |   (Program code)
+-------------------+   ← Low memory
```

---

## 🔸 Physical vs Virtual Memory

| Term                | Description                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Physical Memory** | Actual RAM (limited)                                                      |
| **Virtual Memory**  | Each process _thinks_ it has all the memory it needs (huge address space) |

🧠 **Translation from Virtual → Physical** is done by hardware (MMU) with help from the OS.

---

## 🔹 Paging (The Secret Sauce of Virtual Memory)

### 📦 What is Paging?

- Memory is divided into fixed-size **pages** (usually 4 KB).
- Physical memory is split into **frames**.
- A **Page Table** maps virtual pages → physical frames.

This enables:
✅ Memory isolation  
✅ On-demand loading  
✅ Swapping unused pages to disk (if needed)

---

### 🔒 Benefits of Paging

- No fragmentation (compared to segmentation)
- Easy to swap pages in/out
- Simplifies memory protection

---

### 🧱 Page Table & TLB

- Every process has a **Page Table**
- Each memory access is checked using this table
- A cache called **TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)** speeds this up

---

## 🔸 Swapping & Page Faults

When a program accesses a page **not in RAM**, a **page fault** occurs.

OS will:

1. Pause the process
2. Load the page from disk (swap file)
3. Resume execution

✅ This is how your computer runs apps larger than RAM!

---

## 🔹 Protection Mechanisms

OS enforces memory protection:

- **User vs Kernel Mode:** Users can’t touch kernel memory
- **Segmentation Fault (Segfault):** Happens if memory is accessed illegally
- **Read-only Pages:** Some pages (like code) can’t be written to

---

## 🔸 Allocation Algorithms

When processes ask for memory (e.g., malloc), the OS uses strategies:

| Algorithm        | Description                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **First Fit**    | Use the first block that fits    |
| **Best Fit**     | Use the smallest block that fits |
| **Worst Fit**    | Use the largest block            |
| **Buddy System** | Power-of-2 allocation strategy   |

---

## 🧠 Real-World Use

- Memory bugs (buffer overflows, use-after-free) are security risks
- OS memory optimizations directly affect performance
- Understanding virtual memory is critical for debugging, systems design, and hacking

---

## 🧪 Tools to Try (Optional)

If you want to go hands-on:

- Use `valgrind` to detect memory leaks
- Study how `malloc` works internally (dlmalloc, ptmalloc)
- Try simulating a page table in C!

---

## ✅ Summary

You now know:

- ✅ Virtual vs Physical memory
- ✅ Memory layout of a process
- ✅ Paging & page tables
- ✅ Memory allocation strategies
- ✅ How OS protects memory
- ✅ Real-world applications

---

Next, we’ll go into:
🔸 **File Systems** — how files, directories, and storage are managed by the OS (including mounting, permissions, and inodes).

Wanna keep going?

Awesome! Let's move on to a super practical and widely-used part of the Operating System:

---

# 💾 7️⃣ **File Systems**

_(How the OS stores, organizes, and manages your files)_

---

## 🔹 What Is a File System?

A **file system** is the OS’s method of **organizing and storing data** on storage devices (like SSDs, HDDs, USB drives).  
It tells the OS **where** and **how** to store, access, and retrieve data.

🧠 Without a file system, all you'd have is a raw pile of bytes — no files, no folders, no order.

---

## 🔸 What the File System Provides

| Feature                   | Description                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Files**                 | Logical containers for data                  |
| **Directories (Folders)** | Hierarchical organization of files           |
| **Metadata**              | Info like permissions, timestamps, ownership |
| **Storage Abstraction**   | Hides the raw hardware complexity            |
| **Access Control**        | Who can read/write/execute                   |

---

## 🔹 Files & File Types

Every file system supports these:

- **Regular Files** (`.txt`, `.exe`, etc.)
- **Directories**
- **Symbolic Links**
- **Special Files** (e.g., `/dev/null`, `/dev/sda`)
- **Sockets, Pipes** (used in IPC)

---

## 🔸 File System Structure

A file system usually has:

1. **Boot Block**  
   Info for bootloader.

2. **Superblock**  
   Describes the FS: size, block size, inode count, etc.

3. **Inode Table**  
   Metadata for each file (name, permissions, timestamps, block locations).

4. **Data Blocks**  
   Actual content of files.

---

## 🔹 Inodes (Important!)

Every file (and directory) is represented by an **inode**.  
Think of it like a file’s identity card.

An inode stores:

| Metadata          | Description                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| File size         | In bytes                      |
| Owner / Group IDs | Who owns the file             |
| Timestamps        | Created, modified, accessed   |
| Permissions       | Read, write, execute flags    |
| Block pointers    | Where the file data is stored |

🧠 Filenames are **not stored** in the inode — only in directory entries!

---

## 🔸 File Permissions (Unix-like)

Permissions are stored in inodes and enforced by the OS.

Example: `-rw-r--r--`

- First character: `-` = regular file, `d` = directory
- Next 3: User permissions (read/write)
- Next 3: Group permissions
- Last 3: Others (everyone else)

---

## 🔹 Mounting & File Hierarchy

In Unix/Linux:

- Everything starts from `/` (root)
- Devices (USB, HDD) must be **mounted** into the tree

Example:

```bash
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
```

This puts the USB into the directory tree at `/mnt/usb`.

---

## 🔸 Common File Systems

| File System | OS / Use Case    | Features                        |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **ext4**    | Linux            | Journaling, extents, stable     |
| **FAT32**   | USB, old systems | No journaling, small files only |
| **NTFS**    | Windows          | Compression, ACLs               |
| **APFS**    | macOS            | Snapshots, encryption           |

---

## 🔹 Journaling (Why It Matters)

Modern FSs like **ext4** use **journaling** to protect against data corruption.  
It writes a log (journal) before making real changes — so if a crash happens, it can **recover safely**.

---

## 🔸 Accessing Files via System Calls

Programs use **system calls** to talk to the file system:

```c
int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
read(fd, buffer, 100);
write(fd, buffer, 100);
close(fd);
```

These calls go from **userspace → kernel** → disk.

---

## 🔹 Real-World Concepts You’ll Encounter

- **Disk I/O performance**
- **Read/write caching**
- **Disk quotas & limits**
- **Sparse files** (files with "holes")
- **File locking**

---

## ✅ Summary

You now understand:

- ✅ What a file system is and why we need it
- ✅ Inodes and metadata
- ✅ Directory structure and mounting
- ✅ File permissions and system calls
- ✅ Journaling and recovery mechanisms

---

## 📦 Fun Idea

Wanna try building your own **tiny file system** in C? You can simulate blocks, inodes, and folders using just memory. Super educational!

---

Next up:  
🔄 **Processes & Scheduling** — how the OS runs multiple programs at once, switches between them, and keeps everything smooth.

Shall we continue?

Awesome — now we’re diving into one of the **core pillars of any Operating System**:

---

# 🧠 8️⃣ **Processes & Scheduling**

_How the OS runs multiple programs seemingly at once_

---

## 🔹 What Is a Process?

A **process** is simply a **program in execution**.

> It’s more than just code — it has memory, system resources, open files, and its own execution context (registers, program counter, etc.)

### When You Run a Program:

- A process is **created**.
- The OS **allocates memory** for it.
- It is scheduled to run on the **CPU**.
- It can be **paused**, **resumed**, or **terminated**.

---

## 🔸 Process vs Program

| Concept    | Program                                | Process                         |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Definition | A static file (e.g., binary or script) | An active instance of a program |
| Stored in  | Disk                                   | RAM                             |
| Passive    | Yes                                    | No – it uses CPU and RAM        |

---

## 🔹 Components of a Process

Each process has:

| Part                 | What It Contains                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Code**             | Instructions being executed (text segment) |
| **Data**             | Global & static variables                  |
| **Heap**             | Dynamically allocated memory (`malloc`)    |
| **Stack**            | Function calls, local variables            |
| **Registers**        | CPU state (PC, SP, etc.)                   |
| **File descriptors** | Open files, sockets, etc.                  |

---

## 🔸 Process States

Processes are **not always running** — they move through various **states**:

```plaintext
[NEW] → [READY] → [RUNNING] → [WAITING] → [TERMINATED]
```

| State          | Meaning                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **New**        | Just created                   |
| **Ready**      | Waiting for CPU                |
| **Running**    | Currently executing on the CPU |
| **Waiting**    | Waiting for I/O or some event  |
| **Terminated** | Finished execution             |

---

## 🔹 Process Creation (Unix/Linux)

Processes are created using the `fork()` system call.

```c
pid_t pid = fork();
```

- `fork()` creates a **copy** of the current process.
- `exec()` is often used after `fork()` to replace the child with a new program.

Together they implement:

> 🧪 `fork()` + 🧠 `exec()` = new program execution in child

---

## 🔸 Scheduling (How the OS Chooses What to Run)

The **scheduler** is responsible for deciding **which process gets the CPU and when**.

🛠 Goals of scheduling:

- Maximize CPU utilization
- Maximize throughput
- Minimize waiting time & response time
- Provide fairness

---

## 🔹 Types of Scheduling

### ✅ **Preemptive** (most modern OSes):

- OS can **interrupt** and switch out a running process (e.g., time slice expires)

### ❌ **Non-preemptive**:

- Process keeps CPU until it voluntarily releases it (e.g., exits or waits for I/O)

---

## 🔸 Common Scheduling Algorithms

| Algorithm                         | Description                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **FCFS** (First Come First Serve) | Simple queue-based                                |
| **SJF** (Shortest Job First)      | Optimal (theoretically) but hard to know duration |
| **Round Robin**                   | Each process gets fixed time slice (quantum)      |
| **Priority Scheduling**           | Run processes with higher priority                |
| **Multilevel Queues**             | Separate queues based on type (I/O, CPU-bound)    |
| **Multilevel Feedback**           | Like queues, but can move between levels          |

⏱️ Most real-world OSes use a **multilevel feedback queue with time-slicing**.

---

## 🔹 Context Switching

When switching from one process to another, the OS must:

- Save current process state (registers, PC, etc.)
- Load the next process state
- Update memory mappings if needed

💡 This is called a **context switch**, and it's **not free** — it has overhead.

---

## 🔸 Process Identifiers (PIDs)

Every process is assigned a **unique ID** (PID). You can view these using:

```bash
ps aux
top
htop
```

---

## 🔹 Process Control Block (PCB)

The OS stores all info about a process in a structure called a **PCB**.

It contains:

- PID
- Process state
- Program counter
- CPU registers
- Scheduling info
- Memory maps
- Open files

---

## 🧠 Summary

You now understand:

- ✅ What a process is
- ✅ How it's created and scheduled
- ✅ The different process states
- ✅ What scheduling is and how it's done
- ✅ How context switches work
- ✅ That the OS maintains a PCB for each process

---

## 👨‍🔬 Practice Tip

Try these Linux commands to observe real processes:

```bash
ps -ef         # List all processes
top            # Real-time process monitor
kill PID       # Send a signal to a process
nice / renice  # Change process priority
strace ./your_program # Trace system calls
```

---

Next up:  
📦 **Threads & Concurrency** — how multiple tasks run _within the same process_, and how the OS manages multitasking safely.

Wanna continue?

Awesome choice. The **boot process & kernel internals** is where your theoretical OS knowledge meets real hardware. ⚙️ It’s the bridge between bare metal and your running programs — and if you want to write your own OS, this is **critical**.

Let’s break this into two major parts:

---

## ⚡️ Part 1: The Boot Process (Step-by-Step)

Here’s what happens the moment you power on your computer:

### 🧠 1. **BIOS/UEFI Initialization**

- This is firmware built into the motherboard.
- It initializes hardware: RAM, CPU, keyboard, disk, etc.
- Then it looks for a **bootable device** (e.g., hard drive, USB, CD).
- It reads the **first 512 bytes** of that device — the **boot sector**.

> 📝 This is where your `boot.asm` lives — it’s your custom bootloader!

---

### 💾 2. **Bootloader Executes**

- BIOS loads your **boot sector** into memory at address `0x7C00`.
- Then **jumps to it** and begins execution.
- Your bootloader's job:  
  ✅ Switch to a usable mode (optional)  
  ✅ Load the **kernel** (your actual OS code) into memory  
  ✅ Jump to the kernel’s entry point

> 🛠 This is what you're already doing in your `boot.asm`: loading the kernel at `0x8000` with `int 0x13` and `jmp 0x0000:0x8000`.

---

### 🧵 3. **Switch from Real Mode to Protected Mode** (Optional but common)

- Real mode = 16-bit, limited to 1MB memory, no protection
- Protected mode = 32-bit, access to more memory and paging
- Required for writing real OS kernels
- You'll need to:
  - Disable interrupts
  - Load Global Descriptor Table (GDT)
  - Set the PE (Protection Enable) bit in `CR0`
  - Far jump to a 32-bit code segment

> 👉 You're in real mode now, but eventually, you’ll want to enter protected mode if you build a more complete OS.

---

### 🚀 4. **Jump to the Kernel**

- Bootloader loads the kernel into RAM
- Sets up basic stack/memory if needed
- Then jumps to your kernel’s entry point — and your OS takes over 🎉

## ⚙️ Part 2: Kernel Internals (What the Kernel Does)

Once you're inside the kernel, it's responsible for:

### 1. **Hardware Abstraction**

- Provide a safe interface for hardware (keyboard, screen, disk, etc.)
- Drivers handle direct hardware I/O

### 2. **Memory Management**

- Manage heap, stack, page tables, etc.
- Handle malloc/free, virtual memory

### 3. **Process Management**

- Start new processes
- Handle context switching and scheduling

### 4. **File System Interface**

- Read/write to disk
- Provide abstraction for directories, permissions

### 5. **System Calls**

- Provide a gateway between user apps and kernel
- E.g., `read()`, `write()`, `fork()`, `exec()`

> In your kernel right now, you're doing something very basic:

- Reading keyboard input
- Printing characters with BIOS interrupts
- That’s your kernel’s early stage — cool stuff!

          ↓ System Calls
+----------------------------+
|         Kernel             |
| - Memory Mgmt              |
| - Processes                |
| - File Systems             |
| - Device Drivers           |

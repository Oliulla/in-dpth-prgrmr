## 👀 How to approach this list:

- **1–25** → Train your mind to follow loops, conditionals, basic array structure.
- **26–50** → Brute-force methods → learn optimization mindset
- **51–80** → Dive into sliding window, prefix sum, hashmap, Kadane’s, sorting tricks
- **81–100** → Use dynamic programming, binary search, heap, segment trees, tries

## ✅ Phase 4: Dynamic Programming — 3 to 4 Weeks

### 📘 Topics:

- Memoization vs Tabulation
- Knapsack Variants (0/1, unbounded, bounded)
- LIS, LCS, Matrix Chain Multiplication
- DP on Trees
- Bitmask DP
- Digit DP (for the bold)

### 🛠 Practice:

## ✅ Phase 5: Advanced Topics — 2 to 3 Weeks

### 📘 Topics:

- Sliding Window, Two Pointers
- Monotonic Stack/Queue
- Trie + Bitmask hybrids
- Mo’s Algorithm (sqrt decomposition)
- Sparse Tables (Range Queries in O(1))
- Heavy-Light Decomposition (Tree queries)
- KMP, Rabin-Karp (String Matching)
- Suffix Arrays / Suffix Trees (if you’re feeling spicy)

### 🛠 Practice:

- Competitive contest archives (Codeforces, CodeChef, AtCoder)
- String + tree hybrid problems

## ✅ Phase 6: System-Oriented DSA — 2 Weeks (Applied DSA)

> _Tie your algorithmic knowledge into systems-level work_

### 📘 Topics:

- Memory-efficient data structures (Bloom Filters, LRU cache)
- Lock-free data structures (compare-and-swap, atomic ops)
- File-system structures: B+ Trees, Journaling
- Graph compression for sparse networks
- Hashing for network packet deduplication

---

## 🧪 Bonus Projects (Optional but Fire🔥)

- Build a **tiny file system** with Trie or B+ Tree as index
- Create a **network packet analyzer** with rolling hash + bloom filter
- Implement your own **in-memory cache** with LRU eviction
- Simulate **shortest-path routing algorithm** (Dijkstra/A\*) for real maps

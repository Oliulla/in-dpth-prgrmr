# 🚀 **Assembly Language Roadmap: Beginner to Advanced**

We'll start with **basic Assembly (ASM)** concepts, move to **intermediate** topics, and then cover **advanced** areas like OS-level assembly, reverse engineering, and optimization.

> **Target Architecture: x86 (Intel) and ARM (for embedded & mobile devices)**

**🔥 Hands-on:**  
🔹 Install **NASM (Netwide Assembler) for x86** or **ARM Assembly Emulator**  
🔹 Write a simple **Hello World** program in Assembly

📚 **Resources:**

✅ Stack and Heap Memory  
✅ Segment Registers (CS, DS, ES, SS)  
✅ Flags Register (ZF, SF, CF, OF)

**🔥 Hands-on:**  
🔹 Write an Assembly program to **move data between registers**  
🔹 Print values of registers using **GDB (GNU Debugger)**

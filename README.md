# Deep Dive Into Systems Programming & Security

## 1️⃣ C (Foundation of Systems Programming) (1-1.5 Months)

Since you already know programming, focus on **pointers, memory management, and system-level coding**.  
🛠 **Goal:** Be comfortable with **manual memory allocation (malloc/free), pointers, and structs**.

### 🔹 Topics to Cover:

- Pointers & Pointer Arithmetic
- Dynamic Memory Management (malloc, free)
- Structs & Bitwise Operations
- File Handling (fopen, fread, fwrite)

📖 **Recommended Resources:**

- _"The C Programming Language" by K&R_
- _CS50 by Harvard (First few weeks cover C in depth)_

---

## 2️⃣ Assembly (ASM) (CPU & Memory Internals) (2-3 Weeks)

You don’t need **deep Assembly knowledge**, but learning **how the CPU executes instructions** is crucial for **security, performance, and debugging**.  
🛠 **Goal:** Understand **registers, stack, heap, and system calls**.

### 🔹 Topics to Cover:

- x86/ARM Registers
- Stack & Heap
- Calling Conventions & Function Calls
- Writing Simple Assembly Programs

📖 **Recommended Resources:**

- _"Programming from the Ground Up" by Jonathan Bartlett_
- Online Tutorials (_x86 Assembly Guide, ARM Assembly Basics_)

---

## 3️⃣ Operating Systems (OS) (How the System Works) (1-1.5 Months)

Backend developers benefit **massively** from OS knowledge—this will help you with **process management, concurrency, networking, and security**.  
🛠 **Goal:** Understand **system calls, threads, memory management, and networking**.

### 🔹 Topics to Cover:

- System Calls & Process Management
- Virtual Memory & Paging
- File Systems & Permissions
- Threads, Concurrency & Locks

📖 **Recommended Resources:**

- _"Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)"_
- _"Linux Kernel Development" by Robert Love_

## 4️⃣ Bash & Linux System Administration (2-3 Weeks)

Since you’re working in **backend development**, **Bash scripting and Linux knowledge** will help you with **server automation, deployments, and debugging**.  
🛠 **Goal:** Automate tasks, manage servers, and understand Linux internals.

### 🔹 Topics to Cover:

- Process Management & Monitoring (ps, top, htop)
- Shell Scripting (loops, functions, automation)
- Networking (iptables, curl, netstat, tcpdump)
- Log Management & Debugging

📖 **Recommended Resources:**

- _"The Linux Command Line" by William Shotts_
- _"Bash Scripting Bible" by Christopher Negus_

## 5️⃣ Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA with C++) (3-4 Months, Parallel Learning)

Since you're already **familiar with coding**, focus on **advanced problem-solving, graph theory, and algorithmic optimization**.  
🛠 **Goal:** Improve **problem-solving skills for system design and interviews**.

### 🔹 Topics to Cover:

- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, A\*)
- Dynamic Programming (Memoization, Tabulation)
- Advanced Sorting & Searching Algorithms
- Hashing, Caching, and Load Balancing

📖 **Recommended Resources:**

- _"Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++" by Mark Allen Weiss_
- LeetCode (Medium-Hard Problems)
- Codeforces, AtCoder

---

## 6️⃣ Cybersecurity (3-4 Months, Parallel Learning)

Since you're in **backend development**, cybersecurity knowledge is **critical** for protecting your apps.  
🛠 **Goal:** Learn **how systems are hacked and how to secure them**.

### 🔹 Topics to Cover:

- Web Security (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, RCE)
- Network Security (Firewalls, VPNs, TLS/SSL)
- Linux Privilege Escalation & Hardening
- Reverse Engineering & Binary Exploitation

📖 **Recommended Resources:**

- _"The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook" by Dafydd Stuttard_
- _"Hacking: The Art of Exploitation" by Jon Erickson_
- Practice on **Hack The Box, TryHackMe, OverTheWire**

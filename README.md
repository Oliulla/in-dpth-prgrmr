# Deep Dive Into Programming (With Time Estimates)

## 1️⃣ C (Foundation of Systems Programming) (2-3 Months)

Learn C first because it's a **low-level but high-level-enough** language to teach you memory management, pointers, and how a computer works internally.  
Many **OS kernels, databases, and compilers** are written in C.

### 🔹 Topics to Cover:

- Pointers
- Memory Management
- Structs
- File Handling
- Bitwise Operations

📖 **Recommended Resources:**

- _"The C Programming Language" by K&R_
- _"Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective" by Bryant and O’Hallaron_

## 2️⃣ Assembly (ASM) (Deep Understanding of the CPU & Memory) (1-2 Months)

Once you're comfortable with C, learning **Assembly (x86 or ARM)** will show you how the **CPU actually executes instructions**.  
You'll understand **registers, stack, heap, and low-level memory manipulation**.  
Knowing Assembly helps in **debugging, reverse engineering, and writing highly optimized code**.

### 🔹 Topics to Cover:

- Registers & CPU Instructions
- Stack & Heap
- Calling Conventions
- System Calls
- Debugging with GDB

📖 **Recommended Resources:**

- _"Programming from the Ground Up" by Jonathan Bartlett_
- _"x86 Assembly Guide" - Online resources_

---

## 3️⃣ Operating Systems (OS) (How Computers Work Internally) (2-3 Months)

After learning **C and ASM**, dive into **Operating System concepts** to understand:

- **Process scheduling**
- **Memory management**
- **File systems**
- **Concurrency**

### 🔹 Key Topics:

- Kernel & System Calls
- Threads & Processes
- Virtual Memory & Paging
- Process Scheduling
- File Systems & I/O

📖 **Recommended Resources:**

- _"Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)"_
- _"Modern Operating Systems" by Andrew Tanenbaum_

---

## 4️⃣ SQL (Databases & Data Storage) (1 Month)

Understanding **databases** is essential for almost every software system.  
Learn how **data is stored, indexed, and queried efficiently** in SQL databases.

### 🔹 Topics to Cover:

- CRUD Operations
- Joins & Relationships
- Indexing & Query Optimization
- Transactions & ACID Properties
- Normalization & Data Modeling

📖 **Recommended Resources:**

- _"SQL for Mere Mortals" by Michael J. Hernandez_
- SQLZoo, LeetCode SQL Problems

---

## 5️⃣ Bash & Shell Scripting (Automation & System Administration) (1 Month)

**Bash scripting** is crucial for **automating tasks, managing servers, and working with Linux/Unix environments**.

### 🔹 Learn:

- Basic Linux Commands (ls, cd, grep, awk, sed)
- Writing Shell Scripts
- Process Management (ps, top, kill)
- Cron Jobs & Task Scheduling
- Networking Commands (curl, netstat, ssh)

📖 **Recommended Resources:**

- _"The Linux Command Line" by William Shotts_
- _"Bash Scripting Bible" by Christopher Negus_

---

## 6️⃣ Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) with C++ (4-6 Months)

DSA is **essential** for problem-solving, competitive programming, and optimizing code performance.

### 🔹 Key Topics:

- Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Trees, Graphs, Hashing
- Sorting & Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming & Greedy Algorithms

📖 **Recommended Resources:**

- _"Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++" by Mark Allen Weiss_
- _"Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen (CLRS)_
- Leetcode, Codeforces, AtCoder

---

## 7️⃣ Cybersecurity (Hacking, Exploitation, & Defense) (3-4 Months)

With **low-level programming (C, ASM, OS, Bash)** and **DSA knowledge**, you are now ready to dive into **Cybersecurity**.

### 🔹 Key Topics:

- Linux Security & Privilege Escalation
- Cryptography (Hashing, AES, RSA)
- Web Security (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF)
- Binary Exploitation & Reverse Engineering
- Network Security (Wireshark, Firewalls, VPNs)

📖 **Recommended Resources:**

- _"The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook" by Dafydd Stuttard_
- _"Hacking: The Art of Exploitation" by Jon Erickson_
- Practice on **Hack The Box, TryHackMe, OverTheWire**

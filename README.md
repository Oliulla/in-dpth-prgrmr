## 1Ô∏è‚É£ C (Foundation of Systems Programming)

Learn C first because it's a low-level but high-level-enough language to teach you memory management, pointers, and how a computer works internally.
Many OS kernels, databases, and compilers are written in C.
Topics to cover: Pointers, Memory Management, Structs, File Handling, Bitwise Operations.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Assembly (ASM) (Deep Understanding of the CPU & Memory)

Once you're comfortable with C, learning Assembly (x86 or ARM) will show you how the CPU actually executes instructions.
You'll understand registers, stack, heap, and low-level memory manipulation.
Knowing Assembly helps in debugging, reverse engineering, and writing highly optimized code.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Operating Systems (OS) (How Computers Work Internally)

After learning C and ASM, dive into Operating System concepts to understand process scheduling, memory management, file systems, and concurrency.
Key Topics: Kernel, System Calls, Threads, Virtual Memory, Process Scheduling.
Recommended Book: Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ SQL (Databases & Data Storage)

Understanding databases is essential for almost every software system.
Learn how data is stored, indexed, and queried efficiently in SQL databases.
Topics to cover: CRUD operations, Joins, Indexing, Transactions, Normalization.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Bash & Shell Scripting (Automation & System Administration)

Bash scripting is crucial for automating tasks, managing servers, and working with Linux/Unix environments.
Learn: Basic commands, scripting, process management, cron jobs, and networking commands.

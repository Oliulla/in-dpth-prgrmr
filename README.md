# Deep Dive Into Programming

## 1️⃣ C (Foundation of Systems Programming)

Learn C first because it's a **low-level but high-level-enough** language to teach you memory management, pointers, and how a computer works internally.  
Many **OS kernels, databases, and compilers** are written in C.

### 🔹 Topics to Cover:

- Pointers
- Memory Management
- Structs
- File Handling
- Bitwise Operations

---

## 2️⃣ Assembly (ASM) (Deep Understanding of the CPU & Memory)

Once you're comfortable with C, learning **Assembly (x86 or ARM)** will show you how the **CPU actually executes instructions**.  
You'll understand **registers, stack, heap, and low-level memory manipulation**.  
Knowing Assembly helps in **debugging, reverse engineering, and writing highly optimized code**.

---

## 3️⃣ Operating Systems (OS) (How Computers Work Internally)

After learning **C and ASM**, dive into **Operating System concepts** to understand:

- **Process scheduling**
- **Memory management**
- **File systems**
- **Concurrency**

### 🔹 Key Topics:

- Kernel
- System Calls
- Threads
- Virtual Memory
- Process Scheduling

📖 **Recommended Book:** _Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)_

---

## 4️⃣ SQL (Databases & Data Storage)

Understanding **databases** is essential for almost every software system.  
Learn how **data is stored, indexed, and queried efficiently** in SQL databases.

### 🔹 Topics to Cover:

- CRUD Operations
- Joins
- Indexing
- Transactions
- Normalization

---

## 5️⃣ Bash & Shell Scripting (Automation & System Administration)

**Bash scripting** is crucial for **automating tasks, managing servers, and working with Linux/Unix environments**.

### 🔹 Learn:

- Basic commands
- Scripting
- Process management
- Cron jobs
- Networking commands

---

## 6️⃣ Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) with C++

DSA is **essential** for problem-solving, competitive programming, and optimizing code performance.

### 🔹 Key Topics:

- Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Trees, Graphs, Hashing
- Sorting & Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming & Greedy Algorithms

📖 **Recommended Resources:**

- _"Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++" by Mark Allen Weiss_
- Leetcode, Codeforces, AtCoder

---

## 7️⃣ Cybersecurity (Hacking, Exploitation, & Defense)

With **low-level programming (C, ASM, OS, Bash)** and **DSA knowledge**, you are now ready to dive into **Cybersecurity**.

### 🔹 Key Topics:

- Linux Security & Privilege Escalation
- Cryptography (Hashing, AES, RSA)
- Web Security (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF)
- Binary Exploitation & Reverse Engineering
- Network Security (Wireshark, Firewalls, VPNs)

📖 **Recommended Resources:**

- _"The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook" by Dafydd Stuttard_
- _"Hacking: The Art of Exploitation" by Jon Erickson_
- Practice on **Hack The Box, TryHackMe, OverTheWire**
